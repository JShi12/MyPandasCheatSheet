# MyPandasCheatSheet
**PandasCheatSheet.pdf** contains most common functions in Pandas for exploratory data analysis. I used it as my reference when preparing for coding tests on Pandas.

It is based on the cheast cheet from DATAQUEST (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/), I deleted some that are not commonly used or have been deprecated, and added some that are not included there.
The last part "Datetime in Pandas" is included as time date is commonly seen in varioius analytical projects; but they might be less likely tested in coding tests.

To keep the cheatsheet impact, no data sample is given to test the code in the notebook file **PandasCheatSheet.ipynb**. Another notebook with sample dataframe and results output are provided separately as **PandasBasicsWithExamples.ipynb**.
