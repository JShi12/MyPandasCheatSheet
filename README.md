# MyPandasCheatSheet
This is a cheat sheet I prepared for data science coding tests on Pandas. It contains most common functions.
It is based on the cheast cheet from DATAQUEST (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/), I deleted some that are not commonly used or have been eprecated, and added some that are not included there.
The last part "Datetime in Pandas" is included as time date is commonly seen in varioius analytical projects; but they might be less likely tested in coding tests.
